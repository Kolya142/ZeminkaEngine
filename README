MIGRATED TO https://codeberg.org/Kolya142/ZeminkaEngine. OLD COMMITS STILL AVALIABLE ON GITHUB https://github.com/Kolya142/ZeminkaEngine/tree/7290df2a6973be2e99f26c8f907910b3b8dcca14.

I'd migrated this project to CodeBerg because GitHub has these problems:
1. it's under Microsoft®, a corparation that doesn't respect users' freedom.
2. it's more a social network with parts of Git hosting service than just a Git hosting service
3. it's slightly moving from „real programming” to AI slop programming
4. its interface is actually very complicated when CodeBerg's interface is very simple Forgejo
5. it's training Github Copilot® on users' code even from private repositories and i don't want training AI on code from my game engine
